# California Houses Trends and Analysis

This project explores the California housing market, focusing on analyzing trends and predicting house prices. By utilizing a combination of data visualization and machine learning techniques, this analysis uncovers the key factors influencing housing prices across different regions in California.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:  
  - The dataset used in this project includes various features related to housing prices in California, such as location, size, and amenities.
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing steps were undertaken to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis, including handling missing values and outliers.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - A detailed exploration of the data was performed to identify trends and relationships between different variables.
  - Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices were used to gain insights into how features like location and house size impact prices.

- **Feature Engineering**:  
  - New features were created to improve the predictive power of the models, including metrics like 'price per square foot' and 'proximity to urban centers'.
  - Feature selection techniques were applied to identify the most important predictors for house prices.

- **Machine Learning Models**:  
  - Several machine learning algorithms were employed to build predictive models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
  - The models were trained and evaluated based on their accuracy and ability to generalize to unseen data, using metrics like RMSE and RÂ² scores.

- **Results and Insights**:  
  - The analysis revealed significant factors that drive housing prices, such as proximity to metropolitan areas, property size, and neighborhood characteristics.
  - The predictive models developed in this project can be used to estimate house prices with a reasonable degree of accuracy, offering valuable insights for real estate professionals, investors, and potential homebuyers.
